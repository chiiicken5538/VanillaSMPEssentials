## PLUGIN TOTALLY UNFINISHED

# Vanilla SMP Essentials
This Plugin is a lightweight plugin designed to enhance gameplay without getting away from the classic Minecraft Vanilla Multiplayer feeling

The Plugin is almost 100% customizable by using the config.yml file in your plugins folder.

By default, the plugin is using local Storage inside the plugins folder, but I would recommend switching the Storage Mode to "SQL" for Data storing. You can change this inside of the configuration file.   

### Features
- Playtime Tracking
- Death Coordinates 
- Inventory restoring
- Death chests 
- Player collectibles
